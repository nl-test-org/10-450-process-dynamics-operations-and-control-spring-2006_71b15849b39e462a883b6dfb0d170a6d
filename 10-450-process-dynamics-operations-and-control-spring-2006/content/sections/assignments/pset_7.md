description: This problem set allows us to update the simulator with a full PID controller
  algorithm. We then calculate the performance of a first order system under PI control.
  We can compare our results to examples in the Lesson notes, which were derived from
  analytic solutions to the system model. Your task is to represent the sketchily-described
  deviation-variable system in the physical variables used by the simulator.
