description: This problem set concerns representing nonlinear processes with linear
  system models. Our exothermic reactor can exhibit multiple steady-states for some
  values of the input variables and parameters. In this case, how do you define a
  single "reference condition" for a linear model, as we have in previous Lessons?
  Suppose we pick a single reference, and then fit the linear model around that condition.
  How well does that linear model describe changes near the reference condition? at
  one of the other possible references? Finally, we use numerical methods to solve
  the nonlinear model, looking particularly at the unstable behavior. Use the spreadsheet
  "exothermic reactor for pset8.xls" to calculate steady-state conditions. Use your
  Matlab simulator code to solve the nonlinear problem.
